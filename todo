urgent:
	make it work on real hardware
	enable the A20 line with a better way and document it (also document more about how the a20 line works)
	serial driver for debugging
	add VA to printf (so you could test scrolling)

non-urgent:
	multi-boot support
	interrupt support
	user space support
	arm boot-loader 
	gpio driver for bbb
	print color (printc) that prints text with color attributes
	make docs (gdt) (vga) (partially done)


investigate:
	mbr boot-loader
	how memory works
	segmentation (and document it)
