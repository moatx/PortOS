PortOS will be a fast embeddable portable usable secure small hybird elf kernel that can run on mmu-less systems or systems with mmu.

It will follow the System V ABI, and mostly be posix compilant to the extend that porting software becomes easier.

the bootloader will follow boothowto from netbsd. (probably mimic how netbsd boots)
