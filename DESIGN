PortOS will be a fast embeddable portable usable secure small hybird elf kernel that can run on mmu-less systems or systems with mmu.

It will follow the System V ABI, and mostly be posix compilant to the extend that porting software becomes easier.

the bootloader will be simple if possible 

the memory model will use virtual address space paging on mmu systems
