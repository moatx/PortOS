urgent:
	enable the A20 line with a better way and document it (also document more about how the a20 line works)
	fix newline bug
	serial driver for debugging
	add VA to printf (so you could test scrolling)

non-urgent:
	multi-boot support
	interrupt support
	user space support
	arm boot-loader 
	gpio driver for bbb
	print color (printc) that prints text with color attributes
	make docs (gdt) (vga) (partially done)


investigate:
	mbr boot-loader
	how memory works
	segmentation (and document it)
	read about the internals of modern opearting systems
