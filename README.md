PortOS
======

A small hobby unix-like os that TRIES to be portable, which means it'll hopefully be easy to port this to a multitude of architectures. 

This is a hobby os that I'm making to learn unix and how to make good code portable. 

do not use this to learn how to make an OS portable or how good code looks like, because I know that this will show bad code and that's because it's my first time doing anything like this.

Building
--------

You can cross-build PortOS (if you have the neccesary tooling) from most UNIX-like operating systems using build.sh with the help of makefiles.

to build using build.sh:
	./build.sh -h

to build for i386 as an example:
	./build.sh i386
