# PortOS
A small hobby unix-like os that TRIES to be portable, which means it'll hopefully be easy to port this to a multitude of architectures. 

This is a hobby os that I'm making to learn unix and how to make good code portable. 

do not use this to learn how to make an OS portable or how good code looks like, because I know that this will show bad code and that's because it's my first time doing anything like this.
